# Desktop Customizations

This a list of some of the customizations I make with my Ubuntu installations.

These tweaks require GNOME Tweaks which allows for tweaking of the GNOME desktop experience. You can change a lot through this! This can be a bit strange since you have to configure the settings through your browser but you get used to it quickly.

## Installation of GNOME Tweaks

I use GNOME Tweaks through Chrome. This can be installed with:

```
$ sudo apt install gnome-shell-extensions chrome-gnome-shell
```

You then install the GNOME Shell Integration extension from the chrome web store at [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep/related).

## Handy GNOME Tweaks

### Workspace Matrix

Allows for 2-dimensional workspace layout.

### Multi Monitors Add-On

This allows for the top bar and workspace preview on mutliple external monitors.

### Shell Tiling

See [Shell Tiling](shell_tiling/shell_tiling) page.
