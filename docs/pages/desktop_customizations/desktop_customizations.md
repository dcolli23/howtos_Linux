# Desktop Customizations

This a list of some of the customizations I make with my Linux distributions.

## Ubuntu

### Workspace Configuration

#### Workspace Matrix

Downloaded through the "Ubuntu Software" application. Allows for 2-dimensional workspace layout.

#### Multi Monitors Add-On

This allows for the top bar and workspace preview on mutliple external monitors.

#### GNOME Tweaks

Allows for tweaking of the GNOME desktop experience. Can change a lot through this!
